MatchIQ uses the **Dixon-Coles model**, a well-established Poisson regression framework for football prediction, trained on years of historical match data. Select any two teams from the Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, or Ligue 1, and get a scoreline prediction along with a projected season standings table.

No paid APIs. No accounts. No nonsense.

## Features

- **5 leagues**: Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1
- **Dixon-Coles model** with attack/defence strength ratings per team
- **Predicted standings**: full projected table for the current season
- **Confidence scores**: transparency about prediction certainty
- **Live data**: fetches and retrains on the latest available match data at startup
- **Light/dark mode**: respects your system preference, with a manual toggle

## How it works

The Dixon-Coles model treats goals as Poisson-distributed, estimating each team's attacking and defensive strength relative to the league average. A low-score correction factor is applied (the original Dixon-Coles fix for 0-0 and 1-0 results being statistically underweighted by pure Poisson). On each startup, the app:

1. Downloads historical CSVs from [football-data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk)
2. Fits the model via maximum likelihood estimation
3. Serves predictions through a simple Flask API

Accuracy sits around **55-60% correct result** (Win/Draw/Loss), roughly in line with academic benchmarks for this model class.

## Running locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Frisbiz/MatchIQ.git
cd MatchIQ/premier-league-predictor

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Open [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). The first load takes 30-60 seconds while data downloads and the model trains.

## Deployment

The app is deployed on Render's free tier. The `render.yaml` in this repo is all you need. Fork it, connect your repo on [render.com](https://render.com), and it'll deploy automatically.

One caveat with the free tier: the service spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity, so the first request after idle will be slow. Upgrade to a paid instance if you want it always-on.

## Limitations worth knowing

- Predictions don't account for injuries, suspensions, or squad rotation
- Data updates are limited to what football-data.co.uk publishes (usually a day or two behind)
- The model has no concept of cup fatigue, European games, or managerial changes
- Dixon-Coles is a solid baseline but not state-of-the-art. Don't bet money on this.

## Data

All match data sourced from [football-data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk), a free, well-maintained dataset that's been around since the early 2000s.

## License

MIT. Do whatever you want with it.
